# Public Org-Structure Database (Prototype)

This repo hosts a static website (GitHub Pages) for a research database.

## Quick start
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push these files.
2. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, set Source to `Deploy from a branch` and select `main` and root (`/`) or `/docs` if you move files.
3. Update `_config.yml` (title, url, baseurl) and the content in `index.md` and `pages/*`.
4. Place approved public data files in `/data`. Put sample files in `/samples`.
