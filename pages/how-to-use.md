# How to Use

## Merging & Identifiers
Use common identifiers present in the dataset such as `gvkey`, `CUSIP`, and `ticker`. If you maintain `CIK` locally, you can map to SEC sources.

## Citation
If you use this database, please cite the project and this website (see `CITATION.cff`).

## License
See `LICENSE`. A permissive data license (e.g., CC BY 4.0) is typical unless your advisor specifies otherwise.

## Example Questions
- How did CXO role prevalence evolve over time by sector?
- Are primary vs. support functions differently represented across industries?
- Did hierarchical depth (VP/SVP/EVP mix) change around specific shocks?
